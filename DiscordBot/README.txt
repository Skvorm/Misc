A simple Discord Bot that allows users to roll various-sided dice(d6,d10,d20,etc) or random numbers in a range, and also allows users to play a very simple card game(assigns card to each user in the calling channel, highest cards win).

	Can be used with minimum and maximum range
	Can also be used to emulate dice rolls with a variable number of dice and number of sides
	Example
		!roll 1-100
		!roll 3d6
		!roll 1d20
!card
	-draws a card for each user currently in the same voice channel as the sending user. The highest value is the winner.(Very Exciting, I know)
